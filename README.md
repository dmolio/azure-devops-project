# Azure DevOps Project

This project demonstrates a comprehensive Azure-based solution for CI/CD, containerization, security, and monitoring based on a job description for a digital architecture role.

## Components

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Using GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Using Terraform or ARM templates.
- **Containerization**: Docker and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
- **Security**: Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Azure Sentinel.
- **Monitoring**: Azure Monitor for alerting and incident management.
- **Integration**: Simulated integration with COTS and vendor systems.

## Environments

- **Dev**: Development environment for testing new features.
- **Staging**: Pre-production environment for final testing.
- **Prod**: Production environment for live deployment.

## Next Steps

1. Set up GitHub Actions workflows and pipelines.
2. Define infrastructure with Terraform or ARM templates.
3. Create Docker containers and deploy to AKS.
4. Configure security and monitoring tools.
5. Document integration points with external systems.
